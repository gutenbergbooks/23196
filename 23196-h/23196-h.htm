			Dear little house, dear shabby street,<br>
			Dear books and beds and food to eat!<br>
			How feeble words are to express<br>
			The facets of your tenderness.<br>
<br>
			How white the sun comes through the pane!<br>
			In tinkling music drips the rain!<br>
			How burning bright the furnace glows!<br>
			What paths to shovel when it snows!<br>
			<br>
			O dearly loved Long Island trains!<br>
			O well remembered joys and pains....<br>
			How near the housetops Beauty leans<br>
			Along that little street in Queens!<br>
<br>
			Let these poor rhymes abide for proof<br>
			Joy dwells beneath a humble roof;<br>
			Heaven is not built of country seats<br>
			But little queer suburban streets!<br>

			Next time you call for collars<br>
			In his steamy little shop,<br>
			Observe how tight his pigtail<br>
			Is coiled and piled on top.<br>
			But late at night he lets it hang<br>
			And thinks of the Yang-tse-kiang.

			Her eyes are sealed with peace, but as I touch<br>
			The girlish cheek, her lips are tremulous<br>
			With secret knowing smiles. In her boudoir<br>
			(Her "sulking room" I call it: did you know<br>

			The packages of cereals, or fill up<br>
			The breakfast sugar bowl; and empty out<br>
			The icebox pan into the singing night.<br>

			Then, as I fixed the cushions on the porch,<br>
			I wondered whether God, while wandering<br>
			Through his big house, the World, householderwise,<br>
			Does also quietly set things aright,<br>
			Gives sleep to sleepless wives in Germany<br>
			And gently smooths the battlefields of France?<br>
			Dear Father God, the children in their play<br>
			Have tossed their toys in saddest disarray&mdash;<br>
			Wilt Thou not, like a kindly nurse at dusk,<br>
			Pass through the playroom, make it neat again?<br>

			And rode to Cambridge in the rain.<br>
			A careless godlike life was there!<br>
			To spin the roads with <i>Shotover</i>,<br>
			To dream while punting on the Cam,<br>
			To lie, and never give a damn<br>
			For anything but comradeship<br>
			And books to read and ale to sip,<br>
			And shandygaff at every inn<br>
			When <i>The Gorilla</i> rode to Lynn!<br>
			O world of wheel and pipe and oar<br>
			In those old days before the War.<br>
			O poignant echoes of that time!<br>
			I hear the Oxford towers chime,<br>
			The throbbing of those mellow bells<br>
			And all the sweet old English smells&mdash;<br>
			The Deben water, quick with salt,<br>
			The Woodbridge brew-house and the malt;<br>
			The Suffolk villages, serene<br>
			With lads at cricket on the green,<br>
			And Wytham strawberries, so ripe,<br>
			And <i>Murray's Mixture</i> in my pipe!<br>
<br>
			In those dear days, in those dear days,<br>
			All pleasant lay the country ways;<br>
			The echoes of our stalwart mirth<br>
			Went echoing wide around the earth<br>
			And in an endless bliss of sun<br>
			We lay and watched the river run.<br>
			And you by Cam and I by Isis<br>
			Were happy with our own devices.<br>
<br>
			Ah, can we ever know again<br>
			Such friends as were those chosen men,<br>
			Such men to drink, to bike, to smoke with,<br>
			To worship with, or lie and joke with?<br>
			Never again, my lads, we'll see<br>
			The life we led at twenty-three.<br>
			Never again, perhaps, shall I<br>
			Go flashing bravely down the High<br>
			To see, in that transcendent hour,<br>
			The sunset glow on Magdalen Tower.<br>

			Dear Rupert Brooke, your words recall<br>
			Those endless afternoons, and all<br>
			Your Cambridge&mdash;which I loved as one<br>
			Who was her grandson, not her son.<br>
			O ripples where the river slacks<br>
			In greening eddies round the "backs";<br>
			Where men have dreamed such gallant things<br>
			Under the old stone bridge at <i>King's</i>,<br>
			Or leaned to feed the silver swans<br>
			By the tennis meads at <i>John's</i>.<br>
			O Granta's water, cold and fresh,<br>
			Kissing the warm and eager flesh<br>
			Under the willow's breathing stir&mdash;<br>
			The bathing pool at <i>Grantchester</i>....<br>
			What words can tell, what words can praise<br>
			The burly savour of those days!<br>
<br>
			Dear singing lad, those days are dead<br>
			And gone for aye your golden head;<br>
			And many other well-loved men<br>
			Will never dine in Hall again.<br>
			I too have lived remembered hours<br>
			In Cambridge; heard the summer showers<br>
			Make music on old <i>Heffer's</i> pane<br>
			While I was reading Pepys or Taine.<br>
			Through <i>Trumpington</i> and <i>Grantchester</i><br>
			I used to roll on <i>Shotover</i>;<br>
			At <i>Hauxton Bridge</i> my lamp would light<br>
			And sleep in <i>Royston</i>, for the night.<br>
			Or to <i>Five Miles from Anywhere</i><br>
			I used to scull; and sit and swear<br>
			While wasps attacked my bread and jam<br>
			Those summer evenings on the Cam.<br>
			(O crispy English cottage-loaves<br>
			Baked in ovens, not in stoves!<br>
			O white unsalted English butter<br>
			O satisfaction none can utter!) ...<br>
<br>
			To think that while those joys I knew<br>
			In Cambridge, I did not know you.<br>

			Often, on afternoons grey and sombre,<br>
			When clouds lie low and dark with rain,<br>
			A random bell strikes a chord familiar<br>
			And I hear the Oxford chimes again.<br>
			Never I see a swift stream running<br>
			Cold and full from shore to shore,<br>
			But I think of Isis, and remember<br>
			The leaping boat and the throbbing oar.<br>
<br>
			O my brothers, my more than brothers&mdash;<br>
			Lost and gone are those days indeed:<br>
			Where are the bells, the gowns, the voices,<br>
			All that made us one blood and breed?<br>
			Gone&mdash;and in many an unknown pitfall<br>
			You have swinked, and died like men&mdash;<br>
			And here I sit in a quiet chamber<br>
			Writing on paper with a pen.<br>
<br>
			O my brothers, my more than brothers&mdash;<br>
			Big, intolerant, gallant boys!<br>
			Going to war as into a boatrace,<br>
			Full of laughter and fond of noise!<br>
			I can imagine your smile: how eager,<br>
			Nervous for the suspense to be done&mdash;<br>
			And I remember the Iffley meadows,<br>
			The crew alert for the starting gun.<br>
<br>
			Old grey city, O dear grey city,<br>
			How young we were, and how close to Truth!<br>
			We envied no one, we hated no one,<br>
			All was magical to our youth.<br>
			Still, in the hall of the Triple Roses,<br>
			The cannel casts its ruddy span,<br>
			And still the garden gate discloses<br>
			The message <i>Manners Makyth Man</i>.<br>
<br>
			Then I recall that an Oxford college,<br>
			Setting a stone for those who have died,<br>
			Nobly remembered all her children&mdash;<br>
			Even those on the German side.<br>
			That was Oxford! and that was England!<br>
			Fight your enemy, fight him square;<br>
			But in justice, honour, and pity<br>
			Even the enemy has his share.<br>

			If those who have been kind to me<br>
			Should ever chance these rhymes to see;<br>
			Then let them know, upon the spot,<br>
			Their kindnesses are not forgot!<br>
<br>
			If any worthy task was done,<br>
			The acts were never mine, not one:<br>
			For parent, teacher, wife or friend<br>
			Inspired the will, foresaw the end.<br>
<br>
			What sorrows do our friends avert!<br>
			How loyal, far beyond desert!<br>
			And yet how churlish, dumb and crude<br>
			Are all our words of gratitude.<br>
<br>
			Then O remember, <i>you</i> and <small>YOU</small>,<br>
			My old familiars, leal and true&mdash;<br>
			The love that bonded you and me<br>
			Is not forgot, will never be!

<h4>A GRUB STREET RECESSIONAL</h4>

			 O noble gracious English tongue<br>
			Whose fibres we so sadly twist,<br>
			For caitiff measures he has sung<br>
			Have pardon on the journalist.<br>
<br>
			For mumbled metre, leaden pun,<br>
			For slipshod rhyme, and lazy word,<br>
			Have pity on this graceless one&mdash;<br>
			Thy mercy on Thy servant, Lord!<br>
<br>
			The metaphors and tropes depart,<br>
			Our little clippings fade and bleach:<br>
			There is no virtue and no art<br>
			Save in straightforward Saxon speech.<br>
<br>
			Yet not in ignorance or spite,<br>
			Nor with Thy noble past forgot<br>
			We sinned: indeed we had to write<br>
			To keep a fire beneath the pot.<br>
<br>
			Then grant that in the coming time,<br>
			With inky hand and polished sleeve,<br>
			In lucid prose or honest rhyme<br>
			Some worthy task we may achieve&mdash;<br>
<br>
			Some pinnacled and marbled phrase,<br>
			Some lyric, breaking like the sea,<br>
			That we may learn, not hoping praise,<br>
			The gift of Thy simplicity.
